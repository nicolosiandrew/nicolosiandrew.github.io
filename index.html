    <section id="aboutme">

      <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Andrew Nicolosi and I grew up in New York. I am currently a student at the <a href="http://welcome.miami.edu/" title="University of Miami"> University of Miami</a> double majoring in Broadcast Journalism and Media Management.</p>

      <p>I have hands-on experience in a professional television studio environment, as well as creative behind the scenes skills in producing and writing. In addition to my experience, I bring an eagerness to learn, in any way possible. I am flexible and willing to work odd hours in exchange to further my knowledge of the television industry.</p>

      <p>Please consider the following highlights from my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>I am an active volunteer for three years at my universityâ€™s television station, UMTV, to gain knowledge in every technical and creative aspect in television production and broadcast.</li>
        <li>I have interned at Univision and Fusion   studios under the current Production Manager to assist in day-to-day tasks ranging from in-studio crew, control room personnel, media management assistant, editor, and writer.</li>
        <li>I produced and directed a video for Univision that is shown to newly recruited interns at the company. This video is available to view in my <a href="portfolio.html"> portfolio</a>.</li>
        <li>I am comfortable using Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator. I have created an entire magazine using these programs that is highlighted in my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My resume illustrates specific examples of my leadership and achievements. I thrive in demanding and high pace environments. I also excel when asked to collaborate with diverse teams and forge consensus. I am highly motivated, observant, detail-oriented and responsive, with a strong desire to exceed expectations and deliver the effort necessary to achieve any goal.</p>

      <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss employment positions. Feel free to reach me through my provided <a href="contact.html">contact</a> information. In the interim, explore the rest of my website that I have built from scratch.</p>
